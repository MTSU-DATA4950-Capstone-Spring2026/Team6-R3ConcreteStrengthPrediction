# Concrete Strength Prediction - Team 6

**DATA 4950 Data Science Capstone | Spring 2026**

**Team Members:** Abel Berta, Markel Gregory

---

## Project Overview

We are building a predictive model to estimate concrete compressive strength from the mixture ingredients (cement, water, aggregates, additives) and the curing age. 

## Dataset

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Source** | Yeh, I. (1998). Concrete Compressive Strength [Dataset]. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5PK67. |
| **Size** | The dataset has 1,030 rows (concrete mixes) and 9 columns (8 input features plus 1 target) |
| **Target Variable** | We are predicting concrete compressive strength, measured in megapascals |
| **Task Type** | Regression, because the target is a continuous numeric value |

## Git Workflow for Team Collaboration

### Current Phase: EDA & Data Preparation

During the early stages of the project (EDA and data preparation), use this simple workflow:

**Before you start working:**
1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. Click **Fetch origin**
3. Click **Pull origin** (if available)

**After you make changes:**
1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. Review your changes in the left panel
3. Write a summary (e.g., "Add correlation analysis to EDA")
4. Click **Commit to main**
5. Click **Push origin**

> 💡 **Tip:** Communicate with your team! Let others know when you're working on a file to avoid conflicts.

### Future Phases: Feature Engineering & Modeling

As the project progresses to more complex development (feature engineering, modeling, evaluation), adopt a **feature branch workflow** to enable parallel development and code review:

**Creating a new branch:**
1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. Click **Current Branch** dropdown
3. Click **New Branch**
4. Name it descriptively (e.g., `feature/baseline-model`)
5. Click **Create Branch**

**Working on your branch:**
1. Make your changes in the project files
2. In GitHub Desktop, write a summary
3. Click **Commit to [your-branch-name]**
4. Click **Publish branch** (first time) or **Push origin**

**Creating a Pull Request:**
1. In GitHub Desktop, click **Create Pull Request**
2. This opens GitHub in your browser
3. Add a description of your changes
4. Request review from team members
5. After approval, click **Merge**

**Recommended branch names:**
- `feature/feature-engineering`
- `feature/baseline-model`
- `feature/hyperparameter-tuning`
- `fix/data-cleaning-bug`
